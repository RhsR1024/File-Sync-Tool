Based on the code analysis, the current system **does not** support the scenario you described.

### Analysis of Current Logic

1. **Directory Level**: In `DateMatch` mode (which handles the date-based folders like `260212`), the system currently checks if the subdirectory (e.g., `C1001`) exists locally.

   * If `C1001` **does not exist**, it copies it (so `C1002` would be copied).

   * If `C1001` **already exists**, it **skips the entire folder** and does not check for new files inside it (so `C1001\B` would be ignored).
2. **File Level**: The copy function (`perform_copy`) also has a check at the beginning: if the target folder exists, it returns immediately without scanning for files.

### Proposed Implementation Plan

To support your requirement ("Incremental Sync" - detect and copy new files in existing directories), I will make the following changes to `src-tauri/src/scanner.rs`:

1. **Modify** **`scan_and_copy`** **function**:

   * In the `DateMatch` logic, remove the check that skips the operation if the local subdirectory already exists. This will allow the scanner to enter existing folders like `C1001`.

2. **Modify** **`perform_copy`** **function**:

   * Remove the "Skip if directory exists" check at the start of the function.

   * Inside the file copy loop, add a check for each file:

     * **Check**: Does the file already exist at the destination?

     * **Action**:

       * If it exists: Skip it (preserving the existing file).

       * If it is missing: Copy it.

   * This ensures that we only copy `B` without re-copying `A`, while still respecting all configured file extensions and keyword filters (since filtering happens before
